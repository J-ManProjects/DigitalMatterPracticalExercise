* **Author:** Jacques Malan
* **Due date:** 9 May 2024

## Background:
You have been tasked to design a database for an IoT asset tracking and sensor monitoring hardware company. The company has multiple different device types on offer, each with varying capabilities.

## Instructions:
Design a database schema for a hierarchical grouping of IoT devices.
* Devices have Firmware.
* Firmware is versioned – and a Device has a certain version of Firmware.
* A Group can form part of another Group.
* A Device can be linked to a Group.


## Deliverables:
1. Create the scripts to create the database structure and populate it with a few records in each table.
2. Create a web application that can manage Groups and Firmware for devices.


## Tech Stack:
• We prefer `MSSQL` and `.NET` (`C#`, `HTML`, `JS`, `CSS`) however we will accept it in another stack provided the solution is well documented.
